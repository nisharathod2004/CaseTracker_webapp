# **Case Tracker – Legal Case Management System**

## 📌 Project Overview

### **Introduction**
In the legal industry, managing multiple cases, tracking court dates, handling client records, and organizing legal documentation manually can be highly **time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient**. Traditional paper-based systems require **physical storage, manual retrieval, and repetitive administrative tasks**, making legal case management cumbersome.

**Case Tracker** is a **web-based legal case management system** designed to solve these challenges by providing an **automated, centralized, and efficient** platform for **lawyers, legal firms, and clients**. It helps streamline **case tracking, client management, staff collaboration, document storage, and appointment scheduling** in a single, easy-to-use system.

By **digitizing case management**, **Case Tracker** enhances productivity, ensures **data security**, and provides **real-time access** to legal information from anywhere, enabling lawyers to focus more on their cases rather than administrative work.
